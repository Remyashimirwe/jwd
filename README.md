# 💰 Expense Tracker (Frontend → Backend Thinking)

A practical beginner-friendly project that helps students build real-life programming logic while thinking like both a frontend and backend developer.

This is not just a UI project — it teaches discipline, structure, and problem-solving.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create an **Expense Tracker** application where users can record their spending, calculate totals, track daily expenses, and receive warnings when they exceed a budget.

This project is designed to train students to think logically, manage data properly, and write clean code.

---

## ✅ Features to Build

Students must implement the following core features:

### 1️⃣ Add Expenses
Allow the user to add an expense with:

- Expense name (string)
- Amount (number)

Example:

- "Transport" → 5000
- "Food" → 3000

---

### 2️⃣ Calculate Total Expenses
The app should automatically calculate the sum of all expenses.

Example:

Total = 5000 + 3000 = 8000

---

### 3️⃣ Daily Spending Tracker
Each expense must include a date.

The app should show spending grouped by day:

- Today’s total spending
- Yesterday’s spending
- Spending history

---

### 4️⃣ Budget Warning System
Students should allow the user to set a budget.

If total expenses exceed the budget:

⚠️ Display a warning message like:

> "Budget exceeded! Reduce spending."

---

### 5️⃣ Dark / Light Mode Toggle
Students should add a theme switch:

- Light mode ☀️
- Dark mode 🌙

This teaches UI control and state handling.

---

## 🧠 What Students Learn From This Project

This project forces students to practice key programming concepts:

### 🔁 Loops
- Iterating through expense lists
- Summing totals
- Filtering daily records

---

### ➕ Math Logic
- Adding amounts
- Comparing expenses vs budget
- Calculating daily totals

---

### 🧩 Functions
Students will create reusable functions like:

- `addExpense()`
- `calculateTotal()`
- `checkBudget()`

---

### 📦 Objects & Arrays
Expenses should be stored like:

```js
{
  name: "Food",
  amount: 3000,
  date: "2026-01-29"
}
### Objective of the project 
The project will teach us more about the for and how we can track and also integrate our html so that it we can growth both critical thinking and also in problem-solving skills
